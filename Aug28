coupling refers to the simplicity of class relations
  -high coupling is where every class is linked to almost every other class
  
high cohesion is where you put too much ode into one class where it should be split into many classes

Inheretence is a way for a rogrammer to guarentee a class has certain methods
  many classes can implement the same interface
  a class can implement more than one interface.
  
Interfaces can be implemented by many different classes
  no code goes into the interface, is just good for defining what methods must be included inside a class
  good for polymorphism and type casting
  
interface vs abstract class

you can implement many interfaces, but only one class
use an abstact clas if you want to provide a specific method defiitio, or 
declare a private data field that your data will have in common

go through lecture questions to study for quizzes

equality is .equals
identical is ==

YELLOW STICKERS ON SLIDES SIGNIFY IMPORTANCE, go over those slides if oure having trouble in labs.
