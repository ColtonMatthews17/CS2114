The duration of shaking inreases with earthquake magnitude

To build a new San Francisco, the rubble from the old one was scraped into the bay,
  creating a new shoreline of a very unconsolidated nature.

Loose sediments amplify seismic shaking
The marina disrict, built on 1906 earthquake rubble, experienced some of the most intense shaking during the 1989 earthquake.

Sediments in the Santa Rosa Basin greatly magnified the amplitude and duration of shaking during the 1906 earthquake.
